These are codes that implement the version of Collective-Asymmetric-Reinforcement-Learning-model described in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012404

These codes generate the plots that are in the paper. 

Note: The way the learning rates are defined for the 3rd and 4th plots are different from the one used in the paper, hence slightly different results.
